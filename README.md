## File explanation.
In the notebook file we perform several preprocessing steps that were taken before and during exploring the data. 
This ranges from stemming words and deleting stopwords and other preprocessing of words which is important for classification. 

In the notebook file you can also find exploratory data analysis, data cleaning and the our classification models with evaluation can be found.
You might need to pip install some modules we have used for classification but they are all python packages and should be straightforward do install.
All data files, both raw, cleaned, and third party, can be found in this github page.
